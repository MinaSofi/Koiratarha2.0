# Web2-project Koiratarha 2.0

Koiratarha 2.0 is a school project for Metropolia UAS Web-development 2 course.

Koiratarha 2.0 is a web application that uses the MyHelsinki Open API to show various public dog parks and other dog related areas on a map. A user can register to the site to save their favourite locations and set reminders for visits to those locations. It is a convenient place for all dog owners to find nearby and fun places to visit. More features for the site are being planned constantly.

The app uses a GraphQL API server, REST API server and a NoSQL database.
